An app that displays cocktail recipes.

## Features

_The general layout and features of the app that are planned._

Two main views:

- A view to display a (possibly infinite) list of recipes with a search bar.
- A view to show a detailed view of a recipe with glass types, instructions, etc...

Three tabs:

- A main tab that lists all the recipes available.
- A favorite tab to show the recipes that the user bookmarked.
- A random tab that displays a random recipe.

A Component to switch between tabs is available at the bottom.
